A free, opensource and\r\nextensible mock schedule maker.\r\n\r\n##### Note\r\nThis project is still in an early phase of development! \r\n\r\n### What exactly is Perfect Schedule\r\nPerfect Schedule is an online scheduling application that helps students create their ideal schedules. Every semester, students spend hours creating schedules using spreadsheets or other scheduling applications. Many of these applications are static, and require the user to manually input their course information. Perfect Schedule solves this problem by connecting to a rapidly growing database in order to automate data input. This intelligent tool is fast, effective, and easy to use. Simply tell Perfect Schedule your schoolâ€™s name, and the courses you would like to take. With a few clicks, Perfect Schedule will list all possible schedules that can be made. Saving time has never been easier!\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\nOur ultimate goal is to support all colleges in the world! Expand the database or improve the app if you could!\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n##### Client side\r\n- [x] Static pages with basic information\r\n- [x] Input box capable of fetching suggestions from DB via AJAX\r\n- [ ] /$SCHOOL page -> ['browse courses', 'see available schedules']\r\n- [ ] /generate page -> [fetches courses, renders available schedules.<sup>1</sup>']\r\n\r\n##### Server and Database\r\n- [x] Extensible (has a configuration file keeps track of a list of supported school)\r\n- [x] Feed course data to DB -> if a school is in config file but its collections are empty\r\n- [x] Handle GET '/api/suggest' request.\r\n- [x] Handle GET '/api/search' request.\r\n\r\n##### School Data\r\n- [x] [Marianopolis College](http://github.com/lorix-lpan/converter-marianopolis)\r\n- [ ] Vanier College\r\n- [ ] Dawson College\r\n- [ ] John Abbott College\r\n\r\n##### Bugs and Issues\r\n- [ ] Unable to add react-motion for better UX due to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35787069/react-each-child-in-an-array-or-iterator-should-have-a-unique-key-prop-when-m/35788275#35788275) error.\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n\r\n1: The course compatibility test will be done on the client side\r\n\r\n\r\n## Data submission\r\n\r\nYour school's course data is crucial to Perfect Schedule!
